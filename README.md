Title: DooDooJump

Description: A game similar to the game doodle jump, but this time made with a lot more ways to ragebait the user, inluding but not limited to moving, dissapearing and enemy platforms. 
The user will be timed and the height will also be taken into account as a score system, the game will increase in speed as you get higher into the level. 
Difficulty can be decided at the start which will change the good to bad platform ratio as well as speed of jumping and speed of the killzone that will slowly rise up from below the player.

Core mechanics: Player jumping and moving left/right using arrow keys to traverse up the level.

Win/loss conditions: Technically no win objective, player has to survive or go for as long as possible, loss conditions is whenever the player hits an obstacle that will kill them or they fall below the camera view

Hypothesis: If speed is changed the player will die sooner than when it is slower
example: if speed is 100, player will survive for 60 seconds,
         if speed is 200, player will survive for 30 seconds
therefore survivability is based off of game speed
